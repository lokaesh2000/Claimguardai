# 🛡️ ClaimGuardAI  
### _AI-Powered Multimodal Insurance Fraud Detection System_

---

## 🚀 Inspiration
The rising cases of insurance fraud and inefficiencies in manual claim verification inspired us to develop **ClaimGuardAI**.  
Our goal: to build an **AI-powered solution** that ensures fast, accurate, and unbiased fraud detection — improving the experience for genuine policyholders.  

But that’s not all — building multimodal AI agents is complex, and we took this challenge head-on with a bit of humor.  
After all, if AI can detect fraud, why can’t it also make the process a little more engaging?

## 💡 What it Does
**ClaimGuardAI** is like a detective that never sleeps — except it runs on **AI instead of coffee!** ☕  
Using **multimodal Agent AI**, it analyzes **images, documents, videos, and speech** to uncover fraudulent claims.  

- A magically “disappearing” car dent? Detected.  
- A shaky voice in a claim call? Flagged.  
- A forged document? Exposed.  

ClaimGuardAI catches red flags faster than human investigators — and never gets bored, tired, or distracted by cat videos 🐱.

## 🧠 How I Built It
It took **three hours just to understand the problem** — while hunger attacked from one side and imposter syndrome from the other.  
I tested multiple **LLMs** and found that not all could handle multimodal data.  

When I was about to crash my **Streamlit setup**, my mom (aka *Gemini* — both her sun sign and Google’s AI 😉) showed up with moral support and midnight motivation.  
From there, I connected **Google Generative AI**, **CrewAI**, and **Streamlit**, defining **agents** for image, audio, video, and document analysis — all communicating intelligently.

## 🧩 Challenges I Ran Into
Ask what didn’t go wrong — **everything** did at first!  
- Speech analysis? Tricky but doable.  
- Video analysis? A nightmare.  
- Google API? Rate-limited faster than my coffee consumption.  

Multimodal AI can hallucinate worse than a coder on energy drinks, but I wrestled it into shape — one bug, one crash, one success at a time.

## 🏆 Accomplishments I’m Proud Of
After a **48-hour no-sleep marathon**, fueled purely by caffeine and stubbornness, I made it!  
**ClaimGuardAI** is alive, kicking, and ready to dropkick insurance fraud into next week.  

I battled bugs at 2 AM, questioned my sanity at 3, and celebrated victory at sunrise.  
Now? I’m off to hibernate for the next century 💤.

## 📚 What I Learned
> Sleepless nights and blurry sight,  
> Forty-eight hours, what a plight.  
> ClaimGuardAI, born from madness,  
> A triumph midst exhaustion’s sadness.

I learned the true balance between perseverance, debugging, and caffeine management.  
AI fraud detection? A blur. But my will to code? That’s perfection.

## 🔮 What’s Next
After conquering fraud detection, I’m not stopping here.  
The plan:  
- Add **real-time fraud scoring dashboards**  
- Integrate **insurance APIs for live claim validation**  
- Enable **cross-modal reasoning** for even smarter detection  

Who knows — maybe ClaimGuardAI will evolve to detect suspicious pizza toppings 🍕 or fake book reviews 📖.  

Powered by caffeine, stubbornness, and a vague memory of sleep — ClaimGuardAI is just getting started.
