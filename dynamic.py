The device will naturally deteriorate over time due to electronic wear and tear, but the degree of deterioration will depend on the extent of the damage. Provide monthly predictions with confidence scores in a tabular format and this should majorly depend on looks of the mobile phone regardless the fraud percentage, if the mobile looks goods then its high change that it will come long time.example: if the phone have cracks regardless other AI agents results the prediction should straightaway start from 40-50 and decrese rapidly, this dependes on amount of wear andtear.
